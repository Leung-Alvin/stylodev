New Shurelya's is FUCKING NUTTY
I played Shurelyas Taric with a Jhin adc and they just couldn't do anything about it. 25% MS on your whole team every 4 seconds is massive. Sure, you get squishy, but Taric isn't even that tanky even if you go locket because of his high mana costs. Both Locket and Shurelya's have the same amount of health. It's just a difference in resistances (armor and mr). If you go Shurelya's and play backline while boosting your frontline's engage, your frontline can't get kited. Imagine if Darius had a perma ghost. It just feels so good. Build tanky after you go Shurelya's and you're golden, you'll legit never get kited again if you use your W before going for a stun. This item's active plus your ultimate is also a teamwide Chemtank! Your Q instaprocs it in the teamfights and your adc can keep kiting if you chain it to him/her, preventing them from being locked down.
