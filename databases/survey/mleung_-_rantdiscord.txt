Yes, I hate her guts. However, when she isn't throwing her fits, I do tolerate her. I honestly don't think she's that bad when she's not starting WWIII. There are things that I will say are good about her. I think she's a hard-working person and does well at her job. I think she's quite dilligent since she can wash the bathroom 7x a week. I admire her for being thick-skinned. Yes, she does have some positives. But her negatives really hurt me and my brother.
I leave because I know I won't get any comfort from you. You see me breaking down and saying extreme things. And the first thing you do is not coming over and giving me a hug and saying, "Yo, breathe. Breathe. Calm down. You're not in the right mindset right now. I understand. Take a breather, ok? Ok, daughter?" No. You didn't. You always say how I am wrong and that you need to tell me the correct attitude and mindset.
That she hates my guts
