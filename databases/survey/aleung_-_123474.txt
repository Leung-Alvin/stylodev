@everyone Could I get the code for today
I was exposed to COVID yesterday
my colleague at work tested positive for COVID
I was able to get the code from the TA
Thanks though
No, I was unable to because my colleague told me he was positive TODAY :^)))))))))))))))))))
Was about to head to class before I got the news.
So I'm just zooming rn
