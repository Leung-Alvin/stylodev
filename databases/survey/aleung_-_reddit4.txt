Should Riot change Taric's itemization?
I was thinking about what Skias said about Taric being a bruiser support and seeing that Pyke builds assassin items and it working for him. Could we change Taric's scalings towards AD and tankiness so that Taric could start building items like Stridebreaker as a support without being punished. AD would benefit Taric a lot as he autos a lot and can get double value from AD instead of AP. Instead of 20% bonus AP scaling per charge on Q, why don't we change it to 15% bonus AD scaling per charge on Q. Or, we can change E to deal bonus damage when you build AD instead of AP. This would open Taric to items that are great for juggernauts like Steraks and not punish Taric. AP is useful, but with the current items, they all kinda suck on him unless they are broken for everyone (Shurelya's). Bruiser items work way better for Taric (Sunderer, Goredrinker, and especially Stridebreaker). It would also make Taric top way more viable in a way like Pyke Mid. Of course, there is the problem of overflexing roles that Riot hates (Panth mid/sup, Sett top/sup, etc.), but I think this would be an interesting way of removing him from his current identity crisis as not knowing whether he is an enchanter or a warden, when he could be a support bruiser.
