Today, I went to the Steamboat CVS to try and get my flu shot, but it turns out that they require appointments in order for you to get your vaccination! What the fuck man. I drove home very angrily that my time was wasted. I don't really care when I waste my own time, but I hate it when others waste my time for me.
