Hello friends, this is my first post on this subreddit and I am planning to build my own computer soon! I have recently purchased the Ryzen 7 3700x and other pc components except for a motherboard. I had plan to order a MSI b450 matx motherboard, but knowing the future support of this board is ending, I am reconsidering my decision. Should I wait for the newer b550 motherboards that will accommodate my cpu or, instead, get the current motherboards that still get the job done?
