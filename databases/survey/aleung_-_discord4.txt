DG already requested to sign Tom LMAO
After losing Homme, they are desperate in need of a good coach
Losing the best coach in LPL
If T1 can’t keep Tom, WE ARE IN TROUBLE LOL
I’m forever Tom after fixing T1’s drafts
KkOma is pretty good at drafting too
Tbf
But
TOM & JERRY’
He really hated T1 in the past
I think personally that he really resented SKT for not bringing him [TOM] to Worlds in S5.
They brought Blank/Bengi instead of him
Tom was the Jungle for SKT in season 5
Oner has said that Tom's experience seemed to be very good, so he's got to be doing something right.
I really don't want an authoritarian like Kkoma on the coaching staff again because I feel that it would not feel right for Tom's efforts.
