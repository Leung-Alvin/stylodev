T1 hasn't released any info yet
I think they're negotiating rn
Oner and Faker are still contracted.
Gumayusi promised to resign if he won, so I doubt he'll just up and leave.
Keria and Zeus are uncertain
Zeus said a while ago he wanted to rebuild the SKT dynasty when he just joined the team (but that was when he was still having fun).
Keria was never from the T1 Academy but instead the DRX Academy
Biggest news is the implosion of GenG
after several failed international events, you have to try something new.
Zeus and Keria are also super hot on the market.
Guma too but I don't think Guma would be convinced to leave.
T1 is the most salaried team/organization.
No fucking way any other org can pay better than them.
The only reason I could ever see Keria/Zeus leaving is for a change in environment
T1 hasn't even hit its peak yet
They absolutely slaughtered the LPL with head coach Tom&Jerry and Goach
Guma: Tom was able to predict every single move that WBG took in the Game 1 Draft like a ghost.
They also resigned Kkoma to the team
I really hope that Kkoma is just a general manager
not a coach
