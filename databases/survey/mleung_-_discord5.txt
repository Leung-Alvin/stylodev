So like, I ran into problems with apartment
Because I would have to apply, pay fees and send my bank statements to prove I can pay rent. Gonna take 3-5 days
Not all apartment offices are open Sunday so more hunting later this week
But boi do I feel worthless and hopeless
Anyways, now we booked into a hotel inside a casino for 3 days .
Im only tell you this for now. Think dad will explain to mom once she calls later
