 still can't believe a "heavily guarded" fortress gets infiltrated by an imperial with questionable clearance and obi wan just swimming under it
Also, why is the entrance so open. We've seen how easy it was for the snowspeeders to get to the fortress. They could've massaccred the imperials while destroying their airforce
They could've bomb the whole place by setting off a torpedo from a distance and destroy the fortress
