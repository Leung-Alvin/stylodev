Actually, once I arrive, which is at the 18th, I'mgonna stay at Grand Sierra Resort for about two nights. I will be moving in at the 20th, possibly during the morning. 
Also, unfortunately, I can't bring my glorious desktop and monitor. I had to make do with a gaming laptop instead, though it could also get loud
just wanted to let you know
well, it only gets loud when I play games on it
By the way, have you set the refrigerator somewhere? Also, could you take a picture of the room as well? Thanks!
