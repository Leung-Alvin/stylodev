ah ok
I thought there was a different way we have to do that to a Domain Joined Linux
the toggle is greyed out
I logged into eadmin and I couldn't give him admin priv on his acc
his room is 211 if they're in
He needs two things: Admin privileges still and gpu detection
Just plugged in the Ethernet, and it worked
Eduroam does not propagate the kraid network license
They were using WIFI instead of Ethernet
I fixed the Solidworks issue
it has an Nvidia GPU but it only sees teh Microsoft Display Adapter
The computer has a problem with the windows partition not recognizing the GPU
Hey Brandon
But I can't make his acc an admin for some reason
ur an admin on the linux partition of Chuong's computer
G_G
FLOW SIM WORKSSSSSSSS
Hey Brandon, how do you add someone as an admin in linux domain? I saw you are an admin.
connect it to palmer vlan to fuck with him lol
We'll have to also look at the vlan necessary
