Hi, I was searching around YouTube to find the song played on Game 5s in the LCK. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2YnycvoNU8

I was wondering if anyone happens to know the name of it. Thanks.

Hey guys, I didn't see if there was a post regarding this question, but is the Zerofield Translation team going to try and make their overlay work with the Steam version of Kuro no Kiseki like they did with Hajimari? Thank you.

What do you guys think about going Divine Crownguard on Rakan and going standard AP otherwise? It could be a decent hard engage Rakan item without sacrificing damage and scaling.
