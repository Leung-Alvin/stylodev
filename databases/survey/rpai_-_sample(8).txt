Hello,

This is my first time posting on this sub.

I’m a college CS student learning about Data Structures and so far I’ve gotten only to Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

However, each of them can be identifiable as being ADTs that have certain operations (I.e. Lists have a remove or insert operation or Stacks can pop or push operations) that fit in to one the following categories:

Creators - creates new objects of a type but does not change the object itself

Producers - create new objects from old objects

Observers - takes objects and returns objects of a different type

Modifiers - Changes Objects

Within the three data structures I’ve learned so far, I want to know how do their operations fit into any one of the above categories.

Thank you for the response!
