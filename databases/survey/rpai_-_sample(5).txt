Hello! I wanted to relay you on what I thought for why I contaced you for these questions. Since you're a
Tax analyst, you want a text analysis tool to detect fraud, identify confirmation, and risk assessment. For fraud, you want to make sure your client says
is true to avoid identity theft and tax fraud. For Identity confirmation, you can confirm you're speaking to the right person. For risk assessment, you want to make
sure who you talk to is trustworhty. Just food for thought when you answer my questions. Have a good night!
