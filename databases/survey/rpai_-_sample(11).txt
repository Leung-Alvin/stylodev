Hello!

I’m currently a senior as a computer science major and I feel overwhelmed by the amount of final projects I must do for about 5 classes. Each of these projects are hard in their own ways with requirements that are not normally taught. With that said, a lot of what I need to do have to be self taught. As such, I feel like I’m at a risk of failure, or beginning to feel doubtful of my prospects. I’m at the verge of giving up, to which I’m even more fearful.

I sorta regret making it this far, and I’m very timid in reaching out. Thus, I do have a question for people who have, or had, a similar situation as me. Should I try to complete every project or just do a good enough job?
