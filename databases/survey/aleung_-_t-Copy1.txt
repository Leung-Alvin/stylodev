Hey Nikhil, I will still need the DSL from those problems. It's not the code snippets that are the problem, but the language that they are written in uses Hacker Rank's language, and I was just gonna ask if you can just copy the DSL for one of your problems by logging onto the host account since the default snippets do not have that.
Could you log into Hacker rank and find the dsl you used? The default is different than the ones shown by the 9 problems you sent me.
