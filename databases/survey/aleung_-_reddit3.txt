Taric's E being able to shoot from allies is a cool gimmick, but because adcs are almost always trying to stay a far range from enemies, why not make his E on ranged champions be longer? Taric's E should adjust based on ally range. If an ally is considered a "ranged" champion, the stun should be longer, but if the ally is a "melee" champion, the range should stay the same. This will help Taric players play more aggressively with E instead of using it as a peel only tool. We can perhaps increase the range by 50% so that it is closer to the AA range of most adcs.
