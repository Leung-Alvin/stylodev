Good Morning Aaron,


My name is Alvin Leung, and I am the new Director of Programming for the University of Nevada, Reno's Association of Computing Machinery Club (ACM). Thank you so much for your support in last year's events. Through such contributions, we were able to have a successful year in club activities and membership! In particular, our programming competition and Biggest Little Hackathons were a huge hit among the students, and we received tons of positive feedback through participant surveys.


I am excited to inform you that ACM is offering its sponsorship opportunities again for the 2023-2024 school year, and we would love to have you and AVA Logistics as partners again. Last year, AVA Logistics generously donated $1000 (Pup Tier) to our club. Please let me know if our club’s activities interest you and if you would like to renew or change this funding. Our levels this year are listed below (however any level of donations is appreciated) and I've also attached a poster to this email:


Pup Tier ($1000)
Wolf Tier ($2000)
Pack Tier ($3000)


One of ACM’s foundational goals is to help our members network with various career opportunities and companies like AVA Logistics, renowned for its commitment to efficiency, sustainability, and public welfare. I would like to help the students and members of ACM get to know about AVA Logistics and the good that the company is trying to accomplish for its community. In that sense, I want to provide AVA Logistics with a table at our biggest event, The UNR Hackathon, so that students can learn more about the company. If you would prefer to chat via phone or Zoom instead of email, please let me know, and I can schedule a phone or Zoom call with you. Otherwise, you can always respond to this email.


Thank you so much for your time, and I hope to hear back from you.


Best Regards,
Alvin Leung
