Good Afternoon Shannon,


My name is Alvin Leung, and I am the new Director of Programming for the University of Nevada, Reno's Association of Computing Machinery Club (ACM). Thank you so much for your support in our past events. Through such contributions, we were able to have some of the most successful years in our club’s history! In particular, our programming competitions and Biggest Little Hackathons were huge hits among the students, and we received tons of positive feedback through participant surveys over the years.


Thus, I am excited to inform you that ACM is offering its sponsorship opportunities again for the 2023-2024 school year, and we would love to have you and Infinity Software as partners again. Please let me know if our club’s activities interest you and if you would like to sponsor our events. Our levels this year are listed below (however any level of donations is appreciated), and I've also attached a poster to this email:


Pup Tier ($1000)
Wolf Tier ($2000)
Pack Tier ($3000)


One of ACM’s foundational goals is to help our members network with various career opportunities and local companies like Infinity Software. I would like to help the students and members of ACM get to know about your company and the good that you are accomplishing for our community. In that sense, I want to provide Infinity with a table at our biggest event, The UNR Hackathon, so that students can learn more about your company. If you would prefer to chat via phone or Zoom instead of email, please let me know, and I can schedule a phone or Zoom call with you. Otherwise, you can always respond to this email.


Thank you so much for your time, and I hope to hear back from you.


Best Regards,
Alvin Leung
