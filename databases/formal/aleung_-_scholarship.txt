Dear Selection Committee,
Thank you so much for selecting me as a recipient of the Carano Legacy Scholarship. I cannot quantify the amount of gratitude that me and my family have towards this committee for their kindness. I intend to fully use the scholarship money in order to advance my education so that I can make an impact on the community that I was raised in. I promise to pay back this kindness in the future as I also hope to grant scholarships for many future college students so that their dreams can also be realized as mine have.
My mother is especially grateful for this opportunity. She is thankful that Caesar’s Entertainment has partnered with the Community Foundation of Northern Nevada in order to bring financial aid to those who are working hard and actively trying to make a better future. She has worked for the casino industry in Downtown Reno for over twenty years. Though she could not convey this thankful message in English herself, she wants to say how great she feels that her decades of hard work in the industry has paid off so that she could send her son to college when she herself could not in her own time.
Again, my family and I would like to thank each and every committee member for their consideration, and we hope to not disappoint your trust and opinions. Education is a wonderful tool for innovation. We have come so far as humans because we were able to keep track of all facets of knowledge in order to pave the way to a better future. I intend to follow these footsteps. Thank you for reading, your time, and your consideration. Please enjoy the rest of this beautiful summer.
Best Regards,
Alvin Leung
