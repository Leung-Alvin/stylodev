I play the role that is not in the front of the group. I do not always out with my non-close friends, and I like to enjoy my time to myself. I help my friends with their classes and decisions, but I do not take much initiative in my friend group. My friend Matthew usually is the caring person who likes to take initiatives for outings. I do rebut sometimes if I think an idea is bad. Overall, I play a passive role in my group, but I do make some decisions.
